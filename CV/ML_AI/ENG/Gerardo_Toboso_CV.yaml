              highlights:
                  - Designed and implemented a modular RAG-based backend system indexing academic PDFs and generating grounded responses via LLM APIs.
                  - Architected full ingestion → indexing → retrieval → generation pipeline with strict separation of concerns.
                  - Integrated external LLM APIs (Groq/OpenAI-compatible) with custom prompt orchestration to reduce hallucinations.
                  - Implemented deterministic ID strategy for reproducible indexing and consistency.
                  - Developed similarity search infrastructure using vector embeddings (Sentence Transformers + ChromaDB).
                  - Built structured test suite (unit + integration) with ~70–80% coverage for critical modules.

# My CV — Version-Controlled & Code-Driven

> *Because your career deserves the same rigor as your code.*

## What is this?

This repository contains my professional CV, managed as **code** using [RenderCV](https://github.com/rendercv/rendercv) — a Python-powered CV generator that transforms YAML into pixel-perfect PDFs.

No more wrestling with Word formatting. No more "which version did I send?". Just clean, version-controlled, reproducible documents.

## Why Code Your CV?

| Traditional CV | This Approach |
|----------------|---------------|
| ❌ "Final_CV_v3_FINAL(2).docx" | ✅ Git history with meaningful commits |
| ❌ Formatting breaks between versions | ✅ Consistent, professional typography |
| ❌ Hard to maintain multiple languages | ✅ Separate YAML files, same structure |
| ❌ Manual updates, copy-paste errors | ✅ Single source of truth |
| ❌ Generic templates | ✅ ATS-friendly, role-optimized themes |
